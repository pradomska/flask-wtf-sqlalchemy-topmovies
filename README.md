# flask-wtf-sqlalchemy-topmovies

It's a website that compile lists of my top favourite movies of all time.

I'm going to build a website using Flask/WTForms/SQLite/SQLAlchemy and more. It will allow user to create a beautiful website that lists our top 10 films of all time. 
As I watch more movies, I can always update my list and keep track of which movies to recommend people.
